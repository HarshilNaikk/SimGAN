# Running the Implementation

- Go to the main SimGan Directory
- run "python -m third_party.a2c_ppo_acktr.main_gail_dyn_ppo" 
- you are good to go!

(all parameters can be changed in the mail_gail_dyn_ppo.py file itself.)

## Outputs 

Three plots 
- GAN losses (Gen Loss, Disc loss, Dics_Expert Loss, Disc_SimulatedTraj Loss)
- X1 position expert vs simulated
- X2 position expert vs simulated
